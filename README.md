# challenge
## Setup
Just run docker-compose up! You can run the script ./scripts/test_challenge.py
## Summary
### What went well
It overall wasn't a super hard task
### What didn't go well
I think I struggled to build models that would account for the structure of the conversations. Should have asked for more info here
### What would I improve
Definitely spend more time getting a thorough download of requirements. Also I definitely would improve my folder structure and setup work (I know I slapped it together instead of diligently building things out the way I would have liked)
